# Tantalus-Interactive-GBA-tools
Tantalus Interactive made some GBA (Game Boy Advance) games with actual 3D assets and filesystems in them.

Currently a massive work in progress. All I have so far is a script that partially extracts all of the assets from Tantalus Interactive's GBA games (minus the filenames. They are used by the games, but I have no idea how to access them in a way that makes sense...)
