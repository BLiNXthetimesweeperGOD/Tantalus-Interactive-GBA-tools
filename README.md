# Tantalus Interactive GBA tools
Tantalus Interactive (now known as Tantalus Media) made some Game Boy Advance games with actual 3D assets and filesystems in them. The goal of this repository is to document the formats and how everything works.

### Games that ran on the Tantalus engine:
- ATV Quad Power Racing
- Cars: Mater-National Championship
- Monster Truck Madness
- The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius: Attack of the Twonkies
- The Flintstones: Dino to the Rescue (unreleased)
- The Polar Express
- Top Gear Rally
- Trick Star
- Woody Woodpecker in Crazy Castle 5

### File formats:
Most games only use RBH. It's a RIFF-based container format with a "PIFF" header.
